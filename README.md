# RoboticArm-of-UR5-like
这个项目是一个基于UR5机械臂结构的仿制机械臂设计。采用了步进电机配合闭环驱动系统来实现控制，使用谐波减速器提高扭矩。下位机基于esp32，arduino开发平台，并开发了一个安卓app来实现人机交互，具有单轴控制功能及前三轴的逆运动学控制。所有工程文件和源码均已上传至GitHub，供大家参考和使用。

# RoboticArm-of-UR5-like
This project is a replica robotic arm based on the UR5 structure. It uses stepper motors combined with a closed-loop drive system for control and incorporates harmonic reducers to enhance torque. The lower-level controller is based on the ESP32 and Arduino platforms, and an Android app has been developed for human-machine interaction, featuring single-axis control and inverse kinematics control for the first three axes. All engineering files and source code are available on GitHub for reference and use.
